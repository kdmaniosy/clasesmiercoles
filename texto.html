    <h1>Lover by Taylor Swift</h1>
        <h2>Bridge</h2>
            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?</p>
            <p>With every guitar string scar on my hand</p>
            <p>I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover</p> 
            <p>My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue</p>
            <p>All's well that ends well to end up with you</p>
            <p>Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover</p>
            <p>And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me</p>
            <p>And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover</p>
